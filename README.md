# format-csv-contacts
So i frequentily needed to format a csv file that have some contacts leads with a name and a phone number.
To import in my google contacts to use in my phone, and i decided to make a python script to do this for me, and here is it! 

To use the script you just need a csv file named 'contacts.csv' in the same folder of the script, run the script and the output will be generated.

INPUT:

NOME,TELEFONE
Joao,551599999999
Maria,551191234567


OUTPUT:

Nome,Telefone
Joao,1599999999
Maria,1191234567
